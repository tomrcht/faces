# faces

Sandbox app I use to test whatever comes to mind.

## Why

I wanted to make a dead simple app with a dead simple architecture to test whatever I wanted to. The result is Faces, which is a glorified list where each view is a component containing something I wanted to test (such as Core Animation) or something I wanted to try and implement (like the image zoom).

The architecture is super simple but it does the job. It probably isn't scalable but... it doesn't need to be? At least it doesn't leak memory ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## How

The app is made with [Needle](https://github.com/uber/needle) which is, again, a dead simple DI framework made by Uber. It's lightweight but it does the job well. I could've used something like Swinject or Cleanse but Needle fitted my needs. I also could probably implement my own DI service using static subscripts but this is something I want to do in its own project.

The app (mostly) follows the MVVM design pattern, again, this is a sandbox app so not everything is exactly where it should be.

## This sucks, you should do X

I'm always eager to learn so please, do tell me what could be done better :)
